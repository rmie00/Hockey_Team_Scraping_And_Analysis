# Hockey_Team_Scraping_And_Analysis
In this project, I am working on scraping data from Scrapethissite.com and then will be analysing the data

The code for the web scraper is at Load_Data.py and the database is HockeyDataBase.sqlite

The analysis made so far is minimal however it is available at the My_Analysis.piynb file.

# Streamlit App

Currently building a basic StreamLlit dashaboard app, the code for it is available at the HockeyDash.py file.
